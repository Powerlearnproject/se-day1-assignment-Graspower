Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application 
of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of quality software systems.
technology- allows development of various softwares that improve aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960-development of first programing languages 
1970-advent of structered programing 
1960-development of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements- includes writing codes and building software according to design.
design-involves creating detailed design of the Software systems
implementation-writing codes and building softwares according to design 
testing-conducting tests to ensure software meets the required quality standards 
deployment-is releasing software users
maintenance-providing new update features and to improve the systems

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- is the sequented approach with distinct phases eg. requirements, design, implementation. flowing like a river. while, Agile-is the incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- writes codes according to create a software system solution according to the design 
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensure projects meet high quality by designing and testing systems 
project manager-oversees the planning exceqution, designing of softwares

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE- Provides tools for writing, testing, debugging codes eg vs code and eclipse 
vcs- version control system  provides  tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordination of work among the team members. eg git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines- proper management of time and adequate allocation of time on the work
technical debt- proper application of  methods tools and languages to avoid errors and shortcuts 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test individual components of a Software 
intergration-testing interaction between different components.
system-testing of the entire system as a whole
acceptance-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering- is about creating questions and statements to get best responses from AI models 
it makes your questions clear and specific helping the AI provide best response 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
president of kenya
the current president of kenya
the improved prompt is more effective than the first and the Ai will provide a good response
